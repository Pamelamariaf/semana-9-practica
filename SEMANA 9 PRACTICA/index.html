    	  <h2>LETTERING</h2> 
    <br>
       <p>It can be defined simply as "The art of drawing letters". It's very simple. It is a specific combination of letters designed for a single use and purpose.Lettering includes calligraphy such as blueprints and comic books, as well as decorative lettering such as sign painting and creating custom lettering graphics, for instance on posters, for a letterhead or business wordmark, lettering in stone, lettering for your car to advertise your business, tire lettering to customize your tires, graffiti,[5] or on chalkboards.[6] Lettering may be drawn or applied using stencils.</p>

       <h2>TIPOGRAPHY</h2>
        <br>
        <p>It is the art and technique of handling and selecting fonts to create print jobs, therefore it deals with the subject of letters, numbers and symbols of a printed text, a design, its shape, its size and visual relationships.the capability to create typography has become ubiquitous, the application of principles and best practices developed over generations of skilled workers and professionals has diminished. So at a time when scientific techniques can support the proven traditions (e.g., greater legibility with the use of serifs, upper and lower case, contrast, etc.) through understanding the limitations of human vision, typography as often encountered may fail to achieve its principal objective: effective communication.</p>
