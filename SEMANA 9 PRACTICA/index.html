    	  <h2>LETTERING </h2> 
    <br>
       <p>It can be defined simply as "The art of drawing letters". 
       It's very simple. It is a specific combination of letters 
      designed for a single use and purpose.Lettering includes 
     calligraphy such as blueprints and comic books, as well as 
     decorative lettering such as sign painting and creating custom
     lettering graphics, for instance on posters, for a letterhead 
     or business wordmark, lettering in stone, lettering for your car 
     to advertise your business, tire lettering to customize your tires,
     graffiti, or on chalkboards. Lettering may be drawn or applied using 
     stencils.</p><br><br><br><br><br>

  <h2>TIPOGRAPHY</h2><br>
        <p>It is the art and technique of handling and selecting fonts to create print jobs, therefore it deals with the subject of letters, numbers and symbols of a printed text, a design, its shape, its size and visual relationships.the capability to create typography has become ubiquitous, the application of principles and best practices developed over generations of skilled workers and professionals has diminished. So at a time when scientific techniques can support the proven traditions (e.g., greater legibility with the use of serifs, upper and lower case, contrast, etc.) through understanding the limitations of human vision, typography as often encountered may fail to achieve its principal objective: effective communication.</p>

  <h2>LEADING</h2> <br>
  <p>leading refers to the distance between the baselines of successive lines of type. The term originated in the days of hand-typesetting, when thin strips of lead were inserted into the forms to increase the vertical distance between lines of type. The term is still used in modern page-layout software such as QuarkXPress and Adobe InDesign.
  In consumer-oriented word-processing software, this concept is usually referred to as "line spacing" or "interline spacing".</p>

    <h2>LETTERING ORNAMENTS</h2> <br> 
    <p>ornament is a decoration used to embellish parts of your lettering. Large figurative elements such as monumental sculpture and their equivalents in decorative art are excluded from the term; most ornament does not include human figures, and if present they are small compared to the overall scale. Architectural ornament can be carved from stone, wood or precious metals, formed with plaster or clay, or painted or impressed onto a surface as applied ornament; in other applied arts the main material of the object, or a different one such as paint or vitreous enamel may be used.</p>
